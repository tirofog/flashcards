# CSV to PDF Flashcards

Create a pdf file with flashcards ready to be printed.
The CSV content must have two columns: term and definition.
The produced PDF file is an A4 landscape format with the flashcards layed out in a 4 x 4 table filling the whole page.
Print the PDF file single-sided with the intention to fold and glue the flashcards.
Using fold-and-glue permits to use regular (80g or 90g) paper for these cards as it provides sufficient paper thickness.
If printed at 100% or real size, there are no margings between paper border and table border.
This saves some cutting work.
To construct the cards, cut the paper along the line between the second and third column.
Fold the resulting half-papers on the line between first and second columns, with the text on the outside.
Glue the folded parts with their blank sides back-to-back.
Then cut out the individual cards and you're ready.
